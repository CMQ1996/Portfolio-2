## **Testing & Bugs**

‚úÖ Social sharing buttons tested on different platforms.

### **Bugs Found & Fixes**  
‚ùå **Button hover effect inconsistent on mobile** ‚Äì *Fixed by adjusting CSS for touch devices.*  
‚ùå **Timer not resetting on new questions** ‚Äì *Resolved by resetting the timer in JavaScript after each question.*  
‚ùå **Final score sometimes displayed incorrectly** ‚Äì *Fixed by ensuring score updates properly after each question.*  
‚ùå **Layout shifting on smaller screens** ‚Äì *Adjusted media queries for better responsiveness.*  
‚ùå **Buttons incrementing score at the end of the quiz** - *As part of my testing phase, I sent the game to a few friends of mine to try. One of my friends, Sandra tested the game and found that the score was greater than 10 thus displaying innacurrate results. ![Bug 1](/readme.images/IMG-20250223-WA0028.jpg)*
*I solved this bug, by adding two extra snippets of code to stop the double event*

‚ùå **End of quiz message double event** *While testing the quiz with my friends, as well as my mentor Rory I discovered that a double event was occuring as a result of one of my functions.*

*To solve this error, I replaced the createnewelement in the const message function with a new getelementbyID one therefore preventing the double event.*

‚ùå**End of quiz ammendment removed score out of ten** *The previous ammendement to the JavaScript removed the score out of ten display at the end of the quiz. I ammended this by adding a normalised score calculated with Math.round((score / shuffledQuestions.length) * 10) to show a scoring out of ten*
